# -Real-Time-Object-Detection-Tracking-App-Using-DL
ðŸ§  Real-Time Object Detection &amp; Tracking App : This project implements real-time object detection and tracking using deep learning models like YOLO and OpenCV. The app processes live video streams from a webcam, identifies multiple objects, and tracks them dynamically with bounding boxes. Built with Streamlit for interactive deployment.
