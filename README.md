ðŸ§  REAL-TIME OBJECT DETECTION & TRACKING APP USING DEEP LEARNING

This project demonstrates **real-time object detection and tracking** using pre-trained deep learning models like **YOLO** and computer vision libraries such as **OpenCV**. It captures live webcam feed, detects multiple objects, and dynamically tracks them with labeled bounding boxes.

> ðŸŽ¯ Built with **Streamlit** for seamless UI and deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** for real-time web-based interaction.


ðŸ“¸ Features

- âœ… Real-time webcam-based object detection
- âœ… Multiple object tracking with bounding boxes
- âœ… Labels and confidence scores for each object
- âœ… Lightweight Streamlit interface
- âœ… Deployable on Hugging Face Spaces or locally

ðŸ”§ How It Works

- Loads a pre-trained YOLO model (or other detection model)
- Captures frames from webcam using OpenCV
- Runs object detection on each frame
- Displays live video stream with detection overlays
